1A. 100 clients * 50 bytes lost means 
a memory leak of 5000 bytes lost, because
a file descriptor table is copied for each child.

B. There will be no memory leakage because the child
cannot interact with the parent's port since we've 
removed close.

3A.
Thread 1 has: af, ae, ab, ad, bd, ac, bc
Thread 2 has: dc, db, de, be, df, bf

3B. Even though the two threads overlap at pair BD/DB, they
don't lock in the same order.

3C. Since the two don't lock in the same order, there could be
a deadlock
