In this run, the race condition is between kill calls in line 23 
and line 27. The kill call from the parent process wins the race,
so the handler is run by the child which why it's PID 102 is 
printed before handler1 and the child's kill call for the parent
to run the handler was stopped. Since the parent process was waiting,
the main function finishes executing and exits.

The race condition is between line 22 and line 27. The parent's kill call on
line 27 wins against the child's printf statement so (102) handler1 is 
outputted in the child process. It then prints seeys and exits and returns to
main function, where the waiting parent process prints child done and then exits
itself.

Line Number           Process          Line           Forkret
1                     P                19             0

4                     P                13             0
The race condition is between on line 21 which assigns forkret 
and line 23 that calls the kill function from the child process.
The child wins so line 3 outputs 101 the parent pid and handler1. 
Since the child wins, forkret is never assigned a value so it 
remains 0 so the handler1 function prints (102) seeya and then 
exits. The forkret remains 0 so the else condition is not satisfied
in the main function and the parent process exits.
