Suppose that an instruction representing “idivl %ebx” is at address 0x08031000, and that the address
of the exception handler divideByZero is 0xC0015200.
A. Suppose %ebx is zero, show the relevant entry in the exception table built into the hardware.
The value 0xC0015200 would be stored in the exception table address of 0.

B. Suppose that %ebx is zero, that %eip is 0x08031000, and the CPU is about to start executing the cur-
rent instruction. Describe the subsequent sequence of actions happening on the CPU up until and including
the execution of the first instruction of divideByZero. Include the specific addresses given above, and
how they are used.

The %eip counter tells the CPU to execute the instructions in address number 0x08031000. The CPU will try
to execute the idivl %ebx which creates a dividebyzero. This interrupts the regular control flow and moves
to the exception control flow, specifically executing execution number 0 which is correlated with the 
divideByZero exception. The exception handler then runs the instruction at address number 0xC0015200.
