1A. There is memory and the address range for P1 is 0.

1B. There is memory and the address range for P2 is 6-8
since the should be at least 3 MB.

1C. There is no memory space for it, since there are no
longer 3 contiguous spaces available.

1D. The internal fragmentation for P1 is 2MB. The internal
fragmentation for P2 is 1MB. Since P3 wasn't allocated 
there is no internal fragmentation. The total fragmentation
is 3MB. 

1E. The external fragmentation in total is 3MB, since address 3,
4, and 9 are free. 

2A.

r 0xE5 = 1 | 1100101 ; 0x36 + 0x65 = 0x9B (S)
w 0x4A = 0 | 1001010 ; 0xA8 + 0x4A = 0xF2 (E)
r 0x37 = 0 | 0110111 ; 0xA8 + 0x37 = 0xDF (S)

2B. 
Since there are 8 bit addresses and 1 bit describes the segment,
there are 7 bits left for offset bits. This means the largest 
possible size of a segment would be 128 bytes since 2^7 is 128.
