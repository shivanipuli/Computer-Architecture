Graded files from svn revision 6

--------------------------------------
Question 1 points and comments: 7/10

-2 points:   did not use pointers (e.g., (char *))
-1 point:    code can not correctly identify the endianness 

In your code, endian will always be 0 since what you are doing is essentially endian = !1. You need to do something like &foo to access its address.
